## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to utilize the Horizon API: Forensics tool effectively:
1. **Authenticate**: Use the `Get Access Token` feature to authenticate with the Horizon API.
2. **Manage Holds**:
   - Apply or release holds on users or groups using the `Put or Release Holds` feature.
   - Retrieve hold details with `Get Hold Info`.
3. **Archival Operations**:
   - Use the `Archive Machine` feature to archive held VMs during user logoff.
   - Configure archival settings with `Set Archive Datastore`.
4. **Session Information**:
   - Fetch user session data using `Get Current Session Info` or `Get Historical Session Info`.
5. **Verify Forensic Role**: Confirm and review the forensic admin role configuration.
6. **Exit Safely**: Use the `Exit` function when youâ€™re finished.

### Key Notes:
- Holds apply exclusively to individual Active Directory users.
- Held VMs remain in a **stateful** mode, tagged as *Forensic* and protected in vCenter.
- Forensic teams can access held VMs during the investigation period.
- Archive operations consolidate snapshots and relocate VMDK files securely.
- Held VMs and their pools cannot be deleted during the hold period.

## Example: Running the Horizon Forensic API Script

To use the Horizon Forensic API tool, simply open PowerShell and execute the script using the following command:

```powershell
./HorizonForensicAPI_v4.ps1
```
---

## Detailed Archival Process

1. VM is shut down, with disks and snapshots consolidated.
2. VMDK files are copied to the archival location.
3. VM is re-synchronized for further use.

### Removing Users from Hold
- Converts the VM back to a **stateless** mode.
- Forensic tags are removed, enabling deletion from vCenter.
- Upon user logoff, VMs are refreshed and recreated from the golden image.
